Java Assignment: My Search Engine

HOW the program works:
- User types in a term (1 word+) in the search bar
- Term will be searched for in the existing text files
- If term is found, search results will return match from text files
- "strongest match" will return at the top of the results list
- If user misspells a word, search engine will suggest right word/similar ("Did you mean?")
