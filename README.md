Java Assignment: My Search Engine

HOW the program works:
- User types in a term (1 word+) in the search bar
- Term will be searched for in the existing text file
- If term is found, search results will return match from text file
- "strongest match" will return at the top of the results list
- If user misspells a word, search engine will display "no results found"
- Two text areas, left displays search results and right displays search history
- Search history can be displayed by clicking "search history" button
- Search history can be deleted by clicking "clear history" button
